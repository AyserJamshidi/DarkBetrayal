# DarkBetrayal

This repository is dedicated to [DarkBetrayal](https://Ayser.dev) (an Aion emulator for patch 4.0.3) progress tracking.  DarkBetrayal source code, while incomplete and had its development come to a halt (currently), is publicly released under the GNU General Public License v3 license as it used base sourcecode from Aion-Lightning (patch 3.0).  All upgrades and fixes were done without collaboration as I am the sole developer of this hobbyist server.
